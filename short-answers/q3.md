# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
Benefits of Writing Functions Recursively:
Simpler Code: Recursive functions can be more intuitive and easier to write for problems that have a natural recursive structure, such as tree traversals, factorial calculations, and the Fibonacci sequence.
Readability: Recursive solutions can be more readable and easier to understand, as they often closely mirror the mathematical definition of the problem.
Reduced Code Size: Recursive functions can lead to shorter and cleaner code by eliminating the need for explicit stack management and iterative loops.

Drawbacks of Writing Functions Recursively:
Performance Overhead: Recursive functions can be less efficient due to the overhead of multiple function calls and the potential for increased memory usage with deep recursion.
Stack Overflow: Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth exceeds the stack size limit.
Complexity in Debugging: Recursive functions can be harder to debug and trace, especially if the recursion depth is large or if there are multiple recursive calls.
